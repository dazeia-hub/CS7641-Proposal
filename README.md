Introduction/Background:
A majority of us tend to like watching programming content with similar features produced by the similar directors or casts. Since Bo Pang et al., in 2002, introduced the concept of emotional polarity classification, sentiment analysis on online reviews become more popular. It investigates subject texts involving users’ preferences and sentiment. Our movies and TV shows datasets are featured with originate variables like title, cast, director, ratings, release year, country of production, etc. and extracted from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, and Hulu.  

Problem Definition:
With rising demand of online subscription in online movies and TV shows, streaming services should better their recommendation systems. To retain their customers, streaming services usually release a wide variety of contents that meet the users’ satisfactions. Netflix started a science fiction horror drama television series Stranger Things with excellent production team since 2016. However, each season is released once in a while. A cancellation of subscription can result from the fact that when a user can’t find any other interesting to watch. Our objective is to reduce current challenges and apply popular machine learning algorithms to recommend tailored lists of movies or shows based on the common features of the users’ liked contents.
